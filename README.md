# Elevens Card Game - 2nd Submission âœ¨

##  Updated Implementation (2nd Submission)
This version now follows the complete UML specification:

###  New Classes Added
- **Board Class** - Manages 9-card game board with full game logic
- **Game Class** - Main game controller (replaces ElevensGame)

###  Updated Classes  
- **Card Class** - Now uses string rank/suit, FaceUp property, FlipOver() method
- **Deck Class** - Added Deal() method, CardsRemaining property, Reset() functionality

###  UML Compliance
All classes now match the provided UML specification exactly.

## Project Overview
This project implements a partial version of the Elevens solitaire card game in C# with comprehensive unit tests.

## Completed Implementation

###  Core Classes
- **Card.cs** - Card representation with string-based suits/ranks, face-up/down states
- **Deck.cs** - 52-card deck with Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm and dealing functionality
- **Player.cs** - Player functionality with hand management
- **Board.cs** - Game board managing 9-card layout with win/loss detection
- **Game.cs** - Main game controller for managing game state

###  Unit Tests
- **CardTests.cs** - 6 test methods covering Card functionality including FlipOver()
- **DeckTests.cs** - 5 test methods for deck operations and card dealing
- **PlayerTests.cs** - 4 test methods for player operations
- **GameTests.cs** - 3 test methods for game logic

###  Game Features Implemented
- 9-card board layout management
- Pair removal (cards summing to 11)
- Jack-Queen-King removal logic
- Win/loss condition detection
- Move counting and validation
- Card face-up/face-down functionality
- Deck shuffling and dealing system

### ðŸ“‹ UML Design Implementation
This implementation follows the provided UML specification:

**Card Class Features:**
- String-based rank and suit properties
